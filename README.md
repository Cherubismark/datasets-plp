# Week 7 Assignment - Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Objective
This project loads, analyzes, and visualizes a dataset using **pandas** for data manipulation and **matplotlib** for plotting.  
The goal is to practice data exploration, basic statistics, and simple visualizations.

## Tasks Completed
### 1. Load and Explore Data
- Loaded dataset using pandas  
- Displayed first rows with `.head()`  
- Checked structure and missing values with `.info()` and `.isnull().sum()`  
- Cleaned dataset by handling missing values  

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Generated summary statistics with `.describe()`  
- Grouped data by categorical columns and calculated means  
- Noted patterns and insights  

### 3. Visualizations
Created plots with matplotlib and seaborn:
- Line chart for trends over time  
- Bar chart comparing values across categories  
- Histogram showing distribution of a column  
- Scatter plot showing relationship between two columns
